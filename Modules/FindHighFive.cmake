# - Searches for an installation of the HighFive HDF5 library
#
# Defines:
#
#   HighFive_FOUND         True if HighFive was found, else false
#   HighFive_INCLUDE_DIRS  The directories containing the header files
#   HighFive_LIBRARIES     Libraries to link (HighFive is header-only but depends on libhdf5 which is not)
#   HighFive_LIBRARY_DIRS  Directories for libraries. Pass this to the linker as well.
#   HighFive_CFLAGS        Extra compiler flags
#   HighFive_IS_PARALLEL   Whether underlying HDF5 implementation supports parallel I/O
#
# To specify an additional directory to search, set HighFive_ROOT.
